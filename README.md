## Application Function

The idea of the application is for it to be able to track gaming console users within and store them within an array so people can access different user consoles informaton

## Minimum Project Requirements


* I was able to make 2 commits a week by updating the code manually as due to an issue with me linking my github to my eciplise i was unable to do it the normal way
* My Methods are = Add Console, Remove Console , Count Consoles , search By Console Name and Quit.

## Project Requirements above and beyond

I added another part to the add a console to the database which requests the user to choose the colour for their console

## User Demo

I made the console with asterix as i was used to doing asterix art from other codings assignents and felt it would look the best.

## Roadblocks and Unfinished Functionality

I had no major issues when getting the basic code to function but i did have an issue when it came to trying to add another method so i didnt add it this method would have requested the user to show how many consoles there are of a specific colour but i scraped it since i was unsure on how to make the console colours not = null
